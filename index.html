            <h4>Background</h4>
            <strong style="color: #6118a5;">From a College Dropout to Computer Engineering,</strong><br>My short story:
            <p>
                I am a technology enthusiast interested in Machine Learning. I started my college journey in October
                2018, at I first was enrolled in a Biomedical Engineering degree. But unfortunately, as time was going,
                I
                was no longer interested in it. From then I started to explore the computer science field until I
                realized that I wanted to dedicate my time to computer
                technologies.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I have been coding since June 15, 2020, was when I wrote my first line of
                code. And I am most interested in the world revolutionizing technology, Deep Learning. I am way too
                interested in the
                deep understanding and practical implementation of Deep Learning algorithms.
                I am interested in research, and contributing to open-source projects.

        <h4>Educational Background</h4>
        <div class="education">
            <h5>Mibilizi Technical Secondary School: 2015 - 2017 - Rwanda</h5>
            <p>The study focused on Electronics and Telecommunication systems, where I studied some basic concepts in
                Electrical and Electronics Engineering plus some Telecommunication technologies introduction. I
                completed the program with a high school leaving project designed to detect the presence of alcohol in a
                given environment. And I was awarded a
                high school Diploma in Electronics,andTelecommunications.
            </p>
            <h5>Dropout - Integrated Polytechnic Regional College Kigali (IPRC Kigali): 2018 - 2020 - Rwanda</h5>
            <p>Focused on Biomedical Engineering technologies, and courses covered were an introduction to medical
                engineering and electronics from basic design concepts, monitoring to maintainance of medical devices. I
                didn't
                complete the whole program because I only attended 4 Semesters.
